          <h2>Spotlight Event: Black Lives Matter Protests</h2>
          <ul class = "spotlightFactsBLM">
            <li> the Black Lives Matter Movement was founded in 2013</li>
            <li>The protests are a response to the death of George Floyd, who was killed when a police officer kneeled on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, where he repeatedly said "I can't breathe". </li>
            <li>Thousands of acts of police brutality against black people in America occur every year</li>
            <li>Protesters are calling for change in the police system</li> 
            <li> The protests that are occuring today are much like other civil rights movements in the past</li>

        <p class ="missionText">Everyday, Americans are blasted with jarring headlines from the news. However, the news tends to fail to truly provide the historical and cultural context of current events. Millions of Americans continue to be misinformed or uninformed on current issues, and it’s creating a division in our country, through concepts such as political polarization and ideology extremity. It’s imperative that americans are educated from an unbiased and raw perspective on the issue, or else we will never truly be united as a country. Our mission is to properly educate people in the history of different events that are occurring right now. We want to ensure that people have a good idea of what they believe in and/or fighting for.</p>
