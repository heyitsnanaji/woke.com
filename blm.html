 <h2> A MISCONCEPTION ABOUT BLACK LIVES MATTER</h2>
 
 <h3> Black lives matter should be called All Lives Matter</h3>
 
<p> Black Lives Matter is not to suggest black lives are more important than other lives. Black Lives Matter focuses on how black people's lives are undervalued in society.

 <h2 class= "BLMSectionTitle">History of Police Brutality</h2>
   <img class= 
        "historyofpolicebrutality"
        src="https://artsy-media-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/Ri9ckb_kNWSVSsfHuhz45g%2F46.023.jpg">
 <p class = "BLMIntro"> Police Brutality has always been in existence. It's another direct form of racism against Black Americans. Most records of police brutality go unoticed, even today. Platforms like social media allow us to discover the raw and gruesome truth of these injustices. The most dated source of Police Brutality goes back to the time, profound activist, Martin Luther King JR, was alive. In his words, "We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality" Police Brutality was a cause to be fought for in 1963, and still is today.</p> 
 <h1 class= "BLMFist">.</h1>
 <h2> MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT POLICE BRUTALITY </h2>
   <h3> MLK, one of the most well-known activist for Black Rights, did not condone riots</h3>
     <p> MLK himself said "“In the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear?”
    <h3> Looting does not help the cause</h3>
      <p> Looting has always been a prominent form of protests. Our founding fathers used lotting as a supplement to protest. The Boston Tea Party is a prime example of this. While it is subjective on whether looting is truly benefical, our country today was built primarily on looting.
    <h3> The Police have killed all people</h3>
      <p> The police have killed people of all backgrounds. However, there is a distinction in percentages of deaths by police brutality from Black Americans compared to other groups. For example, black people are 3x more likely to be killed by police than white people.

  <h2 class= "BLMSectionTitle">Black Culture 
  </h2>
  <img class= "blackculture" src="https://nmaahc.si.edu/sites/default/files/images/blog/beautiful-11.jpg">
  <p class = "BLMIntro"> Black culture is rooted in Africa. As slaves were forced abroad to the United Sttates, many practices, values, and beliefs were modified to white culture. However, Black culture still grew due to slavery and racial discrimination and is an integral part of history. The Harlem Rennisance, occuring in the 1920s, made Black culture become mainstream.</p>
  <h2 class= "BLMSectionTitle">Oral Tradition</h2>
    <p> Oral tradition was necessary to preserve history and culture per generation, as they could not write. Oral tradition has manifested into many forms, showcased even today. Black preaches peformed rather than spoke. They carried emotion through their tone and volume, and built the base of what we would deem a passionate and powerful speech. Other aspects include Spoken word and rhyming
  <h2 class= "BLMSectionTitle"> Music</h2>
    <p> In the early 20th century, black americans transformed american music. Jazz, the Blues, Swing were all popular forms of music in the 20s. During the 1970s, African American introduced Hip Hop, a cultural shift in music. Funk and forms of hip hop known today, such as rap, were created by black communities.
    <h2 class= "BLMSectionTitle"> Dance </h2>
      <p> During the Harlem Renaissance, Broadway shows helped black dancers to become more accepted in society. Dance forms such as the cakewalk, the Charleston, and the Lindy Hop, became popularized among white dancers. Popuar African American dance forms, such as tap, have African and European influences. 
  <h2 class= "BLMSectionTitle"> Fashion</h2>
    <p> Black fashion has changed the modern fashion industry. Kente cloth, vibrant clothers, trade beads, and woven patterns are all elements from Black Culture that are noticeable in fashion today.
  <h2 class= "BLMSectionTitle"> Hair</h2>
    <p> Black hair has been a symbol of pride for cecnturies. Hair maintenance was a cultural bonding among generations. "A woman with long thick hair demonstrated the life force, the multiplying power of profusion, prosperity..a green thumb for raising bountiful farms and many healthy children"
      <a class = "BLMLink" href= "https://guides.hmcpl.org/AfricanAmericanHistory#:~:text=African%2DAmerican%20culture%2C%20also%20known,or%20distinct%20from%20American%20culture.">wrote Sylvia Ardyn Boone, an anthropologist who specializes in the Mende culture of Sierra Leone</a>

    <h2 class="BLMSectionTitle"> Impact of Slavery today</h2>
    <p>For centuries, America thrived on having slavery as an institution. African Americans were brought from Africa, and sold to their "owners". The treatment towards slaves were horrific, and left an impact. We tend to think slavery was in the past. However, we can still see the repercussions of the practice today
    <h2 class= "BLMSectionTitle"> Economic</h2>
      <p> Black and African Americans living in the United States encounter a range of institutional obstacles that make earning a steady  income, as well as escaping poverty, extremely difficult. 
        <a class = "BLMLink" href= "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2018/10/10/faces-poverty-social-racial-factors/37977173/">Black Americans are more than twice as likely as whites or Asian Americans to live in poverty</a></p>
      <h2 class= "BLMSectionTitle"> Mental Health</h2> 
         <p>African Americans sometimes experience more severe forms of mental health conditions due to instutional barriers. According to the Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health, African Americans are 10% more likely to experience serious psychological distress. <a class = "BLMLink" href= "https://www.nami.org/Your-Journey/Identity-and-Cultural-Dimensions/Black-African-American"> Check out some mental health resources here</a></p>
      <h2 class= "BLMSectionTitle"> Breastfeeding</h2>
        <p> Breastfeed was perceived as uncultured in the 18th century. However, when black babies were growing stronger and healthier compared to white babies, white women forced black women to give their milk to their white babies'. Black women were seperated from their own babies, created a generational trauma. There are still breastfeeding disparities today with only 64% of Black women breast-feeding, and usually only for 6.5 weeks, the lowest intitation and duration rates.</p>
      <h2 class= "BLMSectionTitle"> Cultural Appropriation </h2>
      <p> Black americans face cultural appropriation every day. Cultural Appropriation is adopting or copying an element from a person's culture. Cultural appropriation is insensitive because it continues the oppression of miniorities, creates stereotypes, and it doesn't give credit to the actual culture. The dominant culture profits off the non-dominant culture, which is essentially problematic. Pop culture continues to appropriate Black culture continues to be through fashion, hair, and music. </p>
