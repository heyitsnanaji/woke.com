    <p class = "center">Climate Change is the defining issue in this moment. Climate Change encompasses shifting weather patterns, rising sea levels, global warming, and many other detrimental aspects of the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming.</p>

    <h2 class = "climateTopic">HUMAN IMPACTS ON CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
    <p class = "causes">Climate Change is caused by a range of factors, but humans have enhanced the effects of Climate Change immensely.  Greenhouse effect is a process that occurs when gases in the atmosphere trap the Sun's heat. This  makes Earth much warmer, and allows life to exist on this planet. Greenhouse gases are essential to the survival of humans. However, greenhouses gases have risen in the last century, faster and at a higher quantity than ever before</p>

        <h3>THREE HUMAN IMPACTS </h3> 
        <p> 1) The combustion of fossil fuels, from cars, electricity, and industries, for example is affecting the climate system</p>
        <p> 2) Human changes in as land use and land cover, such as urbanization and deforestation, results in changes in natural water cycle, emissions from forests, and <a class = "CSLINK" href= "https://www.climate-change-guide.com/albedo-definition.html">albedo</a></p>
        <p> 3)  Eating meat is one of the biggest causes of global warming; Animal agriculture is responsible for 13-18% of human caused greenhouse gases</p>
