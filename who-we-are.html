  <h1>OUR WEBPAGE</h1>
  <p class = "web-bio">We formed this website because we wanted to properly educate people in the history of current events. We felt strongly that the majority of people are usually misinformed about current events, regarding the cultural and historical significance. </p>

  <p class = "Amelia-bio">Hi! My name is Amelia Jobe, I am a high school senior in Boise, Idaho, and I love comuter science. This the first time I've orticipated in Kode With Klossy, but I've loved it every step of the way. Outside of computer science, I am very engaged in my community. I am the president of my school's theater department and involved in my schools' national honor society and Key club. Outside of school, I work with my local mayor's office to create and improve various youth programs in my city. I also work with my locl hospital to train first responders and I am the upcoming speaker for the TEDxBoise Talk titled "What to Actually Expect When Coming Out." </p1>

    <p class = "Chanelle-bio"> Hiya! My name is Chanelle, I'm heading into 8th grade and I live in Arvada, Colorado. I'm not a very interesting person, and I haven't done many things, but when I enter highschool, I'm going to make sure I change that! This was my first summer with Kode With Klossy, and I hope to continue with them for the next 4 summers! A fun fact about me is that I'm currently learning Japanese! I'm about 2/6 of the way learning the basics, and I'm nowhere near fluent, but I can both read and write 2/3 of the Japanese alphabet! はじめまして, と ごきげんよう！ [Nice to meet you, and have a nice day!]  </p>
